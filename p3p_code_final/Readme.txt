Description: Compute the four solutions for the absolute pose [R,C] of a camera using three 3D-to-2D correspondences. Use:

p3p.m under Matlab
P3p.h / P3p.cpp under C++

Instructions how to use the code are given inside the individual files. The C++-implementation additionally depends on TooN and thus also Lapack. A documentation is given at:
